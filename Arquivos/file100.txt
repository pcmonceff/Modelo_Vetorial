                  PERCENTILE SYSTEM FOR WEAPON QUALITY
 
 
     A first level fighter buys a sword... 6 levels and 4 years later,
he is still using that same sword. Doesn't it ever get old?  Doesn't
constant combat wear out a weapon? Presented here is the Percentile
System for Weapon Quality.
 
 
 
Price of Weaponry
 
     With these new rules, a quality rating is assigned to weaponry. Of
course, a difference in quality reflects in the price. So, Table A
provides a price multiplier based on quality. Simply multiply the price
multiplier times the normal market value of an item and this will give
the price of the quality item.
 
 
TABLE A: Quality
 
Quality        Price Multiplier
Terrible            .01
Very Poor            .1
Poor                 .5
Normal                1
Good                 10
Very Good            50
Excellent           100
 
 
Weapons and Quality Points
 
     All weapons have quality points assigned to them based on quality.
DMs should use Table B to get the quality points of the weapon. A range
is given for the quality to provide slight variety. Depreciation will
be discussed later.
 
 
TABLE B: Quality Points & Depreciation
 
Quality          Points       Depreciation
Terrible       -20 to 05           20
Very Poor       06 to 15           10
Poor            16 to 35            5
Normal          36 to 65            4
Good            66 to 85            3
Very Good       86 to 95            2
Excellent       96 to 120           1
 
 
Table C: Strength Multiplier
 
A. Score   Multiplier
 01-03       .33
 04-06        .5
 07-12         1
 13-15         2
 16-18         3
 
 
     During combat, if a player rolls a natural 1 on any to hit roll,
the weapon he was using is damaged in some way. The player rolls
standard percentage dice (1d100) and if he rolls greater than the
quality points of the weapon then the weapon breaks. If the player
rolls the quality points or less then the weapon doesn't break but does
depreciate in quality. The Depreciation given in Table B should be
multiplied by the Strength modifier it Table C and the total should be
subtracted from the weapon's quality points.
 
 
Repair
 
     Items can be repaired to recover lost depreciation points. Table D
gives the repair multiplier based on quality. The formula for cost of
repair is:
 
Repair Cost = Original Value * Lost Quality Points * Repair Multiplier
 
 
TABLE D: Quality Points & Depreciation
 
Quality        Repair Multiplier
Terrible            .25
Very Poor           .10
Poor                .05
Normal              .01
Good                .05
Very Good           .10
Excellent           .25
 
 
Magic Items
 
     Most magical weapons are above excellent quality (i.e. will have
quality points greater than 120). Depreciation is typically -1. The
Repair Multiplier of .25 should be increased if the repair involves
magic. Of course, magical weapons are special and a DM may manipulate
numbers as he wishes to foil players.
